### What is a Variable?

Remembering, a **variable** is a container that holds data during the execution of a program. You assign it a **data type** and a **name**,  
and it can be updated during the program's life.

#### Vaiable syntax

```java
type name = value;
```
### Example:

```java
int age = 25;
String name =  "Carlos";
boolean isLearningJava = true;
```
Variables are declared with `camelCase` names by convention, and must begin with a letter, `$`, or `_` (not a number).
