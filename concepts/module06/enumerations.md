## ðŸ§± Enumerations: enum

An `enum` defines a set of named constants. Itâ€™s a type-safe way to represent fixed options.

```java
public enum Direction {
    NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
}
```

```java
public class Robot {
    private Direction direction;

    public Robot(Direction direction) {
        this.direction = direction;
    }

    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Moving " + direction);
    }
}
```

### âœ… Advanced enum with fields and methods:
```java
public enum Day {
    MONDAY("Start of week"),
    FRIDAY("Almost weekend");

    private String description;

    Day(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
```
#### ðŸ“Œ Enums are full-featured classes with constructors, fields, and methods.
