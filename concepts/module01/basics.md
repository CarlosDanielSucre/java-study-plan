## Module 1: Introduction to Java and Tools

Welcome to the first module of the **Java From Zero to Advanced** study plan.  
This section focuses on understanding what Java is, its ecosystem, and how to set up your development environment.


## What is Java?

**Java** is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by **Sun Microsystems** in 1995 (now owned by Oracle).  
It is platform-independent thanks to the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** ‚Äî ‚Äúwrite once, run anywhere‚Äù.

### üîë Key Features:
- Object-Oriented
- Platform Independent
- Robust and Secure
- Multithreaded
- Rich API
- Large Community

## History, Versions, and Ecosystem

Java has evolved through major versions:

| Version | Release Year | Key Features |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Java 5 | 2004 | Generics, Enhanced for-loop |
| Java 8 | 2014 | Lambdas, Streams, Optional |
| Java 11 | 2018 | LTS (Long-Term Support), New APIs |
| Java 17 | 2021 | Sealed classes, LTS |
| Java 21 | 2023 | Virtual Threads (Project Loom) |

Java has an extensive **ecosystem**, including:
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit
- **JRE**: Java Runtime Environment
- **JVM**: Java Virtual Machine
- **Libraries**: Apache Commons, Google Guava, etc.
- **Frameworks**: Spring, Jakarta EE, Hibernate

## üõ† Installing the JDK and Setting Up

### üì• Step 1: Download JDK

We recommend using **JDK 17+**, preferably from Oracle or OpenJDK.

[Download Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
[Download OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/)

### ‚öô Step 2: Set Environment Variables

On Windows:

1. Add `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
2. Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to your system `PATH`.

üìñ Guide: [How to Set JAVA_HOME on Windows](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html)

On Linux/macOS:  

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

### üíª Using an IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)
IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful Java IDE from JetBrains.

Why IntelliJ?  

Intelligent code completion  
Integrated debugger and terminal  
Maven/Gradle integration  
Great UI for Spring Boot  

üì• Download: [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

###  Structure of a Java Program

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
 #### Components:
 
**Class:**   
In Java, all your code lives inside "classes." A class is like a blueprint or a mold for creating  "things" (called objects).  
It defines the characteristics (data it holds) and actions (things it can do) of those "things."  
Even the main method (your start button) must live inside a class.  
**Think of it this way:**  
If you want to build a car (an "object"), you need the blueprint of the car (the "class").   
The car blueprint describes:  
Characteristics: Color, number of wheels, brand. (These are your variables or attributes in Java).  
Actions: Start engine, move forward, brake. (These are your methods or functions in Java).  

**Main Method:**  
Think of the main method as the "Play" button or the "Start" button for your program.  
When you tell the computer "run this Java program," the first thing it looks for is this specific button.  
Your program always begins executing instructions from inside the main method.

**Packages (Folders for Organizing)**   
As your programs grow, you'll have many classes. To keep things organized and to avoid having two classes with  the same name, Java uses packages.  
Think of packages as folders or directories on your computer.  
They help to organize your classes logically.  
They also prevent name conflicts. If you create a Dog class and another programmer also creates a Dog class,   but they are in different folders (packages), Java knows how to tell them apart.

### Compilation and Execution  
**Using Terminal:**  

1.Create file Main.java  
2.Compile:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

3. Run:
   
```bash
java Main
```

### Using IntelliJ IDEA:
Create project ‚Üí add Java class

Right-click file ‚Üí Run Main.main()
